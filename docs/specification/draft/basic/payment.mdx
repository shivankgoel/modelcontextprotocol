## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

The Model Context Protocol provides payment capabilities to enable MCP servers to request payment for premium features, usage-based billing, or access to restricted resources. This specification defines how MCP servers should handle payment requests for tool invocations using various payment protocols.

### Protocol Requirements

Payment handling is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations.

### Standards Compliance

This payment mechanism is based on the following specifications:

- HTTP/1.1 Status Code 402 Payment Required ([RFC 9110 Section 15.5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-15.5.3))

### Supported Payment Protocols

This specification currently defines support for:

- **X402 Protocol v2**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain-based payments ([X402 Specification v2](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/specs/x402-specification-v2.md)) - **Recommended**

Additional payment protocols may be added in future versions of this specification.

## Overview

The MCP payment specification extends the core protocol to support:

1. **Payment Discovery**: MCP servers can advertise supported payment protocols and their capabilities
2. **Payment Challenges**: Servers can request payment using error responses for tool invocations
3. **Payment Processing**: Integration with protocol-specific payment facilitators for settlement
4. **Tool Invocation with Payment**: Clients include payment information in tool calls using the `paymentProof` field

## Payment Discovery

### Payment Metadata Method

MCP servers that support payments **SHOULD** provide payment metadata through a JSON-RPC method. This metadata includes:

- Supported payment protocols and their versions
- Protocol-specific payment schemes and their parameters
- Optional terms of service and privacy policy links

### Payment Metadata Request

Clients **MAY** request payment metadata using the `payments/list` method:

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "payments/list",
  "params": {}
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocols": {
      "x402": {
        "version": "2.0",
        "accepts": [
          {
            "scheme": "exact",
            "network": "eip155:8453",
            "amount": "10000",
            "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
            "payTo": "0x83240485b70e5c820e5f180533fc6156470cfd0e",
            "maxTimeoutSeconds": 300,
            "extra": {
              "name": "USD Coin",
              "version": "2"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "terms_of_service": "https://example.com/terms",
    "privacy_policy": "https://example.com/privacy"
  }
}
```

Each payment protocol defines its own section structure within the `protocols` object. The X402 section is compatible with X402 bazaar and registries. Future protocols can be added as additional sections with their own configuration requirements.

```

## Payment Challenge Flow

### Payment Required Error Response

When an MCP server requires payment for a tool invocation, it **MUST** return a unique error code indicating payment is required, along with details about which payment protocol to use.

#### Tool Invocation Payment Challenge

When a client calls a tool that requires payment:

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "New York"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32803,
    "message": "Payment Required",
    "data": {
      "protocol": "x402",
      "resource": {
        "url": "mcp://tool/get_weather",
        "description": "Premium weather data tool",
        "mimeType": "application/json"
      },
      "paymentInfo": {
        "x402Version": 2,
        "error": "Payment required for premium API access",
        "resource": {
          "url": "mcp://tool/get_weather",
          "description": "Premium weather data tool",
          "mimeType": "application/json"
        },
        "accepts": [
          {
            "scheme": "exact",
            "network": "eip155:8453",
            "amount": "10000",
            "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
            "payTo": "0xYourReceivingWalletAddressOnBase",
            "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
            "extra": {
              "name": "USDC",
              "version": "2"
            }
          },
          {
            "scheme": "exact",
            "network": "solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp",
            "amount": "1000000",
            "asset": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
            "payTo": "YourReceivingWalletAddressOnSolana",
            "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
            "extra": {
              "name": "USDC",
              "version": "2"
            }
          }
        ],
        "extensions": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The error response includes:

- **code**: `-32803` (unique error code for payment required)
- **protocol**: Indicates which payment protocol to use (e.g., "x402", "future_protocol")
- **paymentInfo**: Protocol-specific payment information

## Payment Protocols

### X402 Protocol

The X402 protocol v2 is the first payment protocol supported by this specification and is the **recommended** payment protocol for MCP implementations. MCP servers implementing X402 **MUST** follow the X402 protocol specification for payment scheme definitions.

**X402 v2 Compliance**: This specification aligns with the official X402 Protocol Specification v2, including:

- CAIP-2 network identifiers (e.g., `eip155:8453` for Base mainnet)
- Structured PaymentRequired and PaymentPayload schemas
- ResourceInfo separation for clear resource identification
- Extensions framework for protocol extensibility
- Facilitator interface compatibility

#### X402 Payment Structure

The X402 protocol uses a PaymentRequired structure for payment challenges and a PaymentPayload structure for payment proofs:

**PaymentRequired Structure** (in error responses):

- **x402Version**: Protocol version (currently 2)
- **error**: Human-readable error message explaining why payment is required
- **resource**: ResourceInfo object describing the protected resource
- **accepts**: Array of supported payment schemes with their parameters
- **extensions**: Protocol extensions data

**PaymentPayload Structure** (in payment proofs):

- **x402Version**: Protocol version (currently 2)
- **resource**: ResourceInfo object describing the resource being accessed
- **accepted**: PaymentRequirements object indicating the payment method chosen
- **payload**: Scheme-specific payment data
- **extensions**: Protocol extensions data

#### X402 Exact Scheme

The `exact` scheme transfers a specific amount of funds from a client to a resource server. This is the primary X402 scheme for tool-based payments.

```json
{
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "eip155:8453",
  "amount": "10000",
  "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
  "payTo": "0xYourReceivingWalletAddress",
  "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
  "extra": {
    "name": "USDC",
    "version": "2"
  }
}
```

**Field Descriptions**:

- **scheme**: Payment scheme identifier ("exact")
- **network**: Blockchain network in CAIP-2 format (e.g., "eip155:8453" for Base mainnet)
- **amount**: Required payment amount in atomic token units
- **asset**: Token contract address
- **payTo**: Recipient wallet address
- **maxTimeoutSeconds**: Maximum time allowed for payment completion
- **extra**: Additional scheme-specific information

For detailed information on the `exact` scheme, see the [X402 Exact Scheme Specification](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/specs/schemes/exact/scheme_exact.md).

#### Network Identifiers

X402 v2 uses CAIP-2 (Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal) format for network identifiers:

**Format**: `{namespace}:{reference}` (e.g., `eip155:8453` for Base mainnet)

**Supported Networks**:

- **`eip155:8453`**: Base mainnet
- **`eip155:84532`**: Base Sepolia testnet
- **`eip155:1`**: Ethereum mainnet
- **`eip155:11155111`**: Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- **`solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp`**: Solana mainnet
- **`solana:EtWTRABZaYq6iMfeYKouRu166VU2xqa1`**: Solana devnet

Network support varies by facilitator service capabilities and specific implementations.

### Future Payment Protocols

Additional payment protocols **MAY** be supported in future versions of this specification. This could include:

- Traditional payment processors
- Other blockchain-based payment protocols
- Digital wallet systems
- Subscription-based payment models

Each protocol will define its own structure for the `paymentInfo` field and payment proof format.

## Client Payment Handling

### Payment Flow Steps

When an MCP client receives a payment required error for a tool invocation, it **SHOULD** follow these steps:

1. **Parse Payment Information**: Extract payment details from the error response, including the protocol type
2. **Process Payment**: Handle the selected payment method according to the specified protocol
3. **Retry Tool Invocation**: Include payment proof in the `paymentProof` field when retrying

### Payment Processing

Payment processing varies by protocol. Clients **MUST** implement protocol-specific handling based on the `protocol` field in the payment required error.

#### X402 Payment Processing

For X402 payments, clients **SHOULD**:

1. Display the payment information (address, amount, network) to the user
2. Provide QR codes for easy mobile wallet scanning
3. Handle payment according to the specific X402 scheme
4. Obtain payment proof (signature and authorization data for the exact scheme)

#### Other Payment Protocols

Future payment protocols will define their own processing requirements and user interaction patterns.

### Tool Invocation with Payment

After payment completion, clients **MUST** include payment information in the `paymentProof` field when retrying the tool invocation. This approach is transport-agnostic and works with HTTP, STDIO, and other transports.

#### Payment Proof Field

For all payment protocols, include the payment proof in the tool call parameters:

**Request with Payment:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "New York"
    },
    "paymentProof": {
      "protocol": "x402",
      "proof": {
        "x402Version": 2,
        "scheme": "exact",
        "network": "base-sepolia",
        "payload": {
          "signature": "0x21a17fba349406ccfab200d45d0bf0861d380b5d56d17ac2df78b56367669018792dc8c56bb68da876158600e787f36561db543b9113105724ea28610d66b8c31b",
          "authorization": {
            "from": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b",
            "to": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b",
            "value": "1000",
            "validAfter": "1766095470",
            "validBefore": "1766096130",
            "nonce": "0xeba19931184d6455732604dedbeb52e0c43dcc655e4e55e550543ecb0d050557"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Successful Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "The current weather in New York is 72°F with clear skies."
      }
    ],
    "isError": false,
    "paymentResponse": {
      "protocol": "x402",
      "settlement": {
        "success": true,
        "transactionId": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
        "network": "eip155:84532",
        "payer": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Server Payment Implementation

### Payment Facilitator Integration

MCP servers **MUST** integrate with protocol-specific payment facilitators for settlement verification. The integration approach depends on the chosen payment protocol.

#### X402 Facilitator Integration

For X402 payments, servers **MUST** integrate with X402-compliant payment facilitators:

1. **Facilitator Registration**: Register with an X402-compliant payment facilitator
2. **Payment Challenge Generation**: Create payment challenges using facilitator APIs
3. **Settlement Verification**: Use facilitator to verify payment completion
4. **Tool Access Control**: Grant tool access based on facilitator confirmation

#### Other Payment Protocol Integration

Future payment protocols will define their own facilitator integration requirements.

### Payment Verification Flow

When a client includes payment information in the `paymentProof` field:

1. **Parse Payment Proof**: Extract payment details from the `paymentProof` field according to the protocol specification
2. **Protocol Identification**: Determine which payment protocol was used from the `protocol` field
3. **Facilitator Verification**: Query the appropriate facilitator to verify payment settlement
4. **Access Decision**: Grant or deny tool access based on facilitator response
5. **Tool Execution**: Execute the requested tool if payment is verified

### Payment Proof Processing

Servers **MUST** parse the `paymentProof` field according to the specific protocol used. Each protocol defines its own proof structure and processing requirements.

#### X402 Payment Proof Processing

For X402 payments, servers process the `paymentProof` field containing the payment proof data:

```json
{
  "paymentProof": {
    "protocol": "x402",
    "proof": {
      "x402Version": 2,
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "base-sepolia",
      "payload": {
        "signature": "0x21a17fba349406ccfab200d45d0bf0861d380b5d56d17ac2df78b56367669018792dc8c56bb68da876158600e787f36561db543b9113105724ea28610d66b8c31b",
        "authorization": {
          "from": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b",
          "to": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b",
          "value": "1000",
          "validAfter": "1766095470",
          "validBefore": "1766096130",
          "nonce": "0xeba19931184d6455732604dedbeb52e0c43dcc655e4e55e550543ecb0d050557"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

X402 processing steps:

- Extract the payment proof from the `paymentProof.proof` field
- Verify the protocol matches "x402" in the `paymentProof.protocol` field
- Extract the scheme to determine the payment method (exact, etc.)
- Verify the `payload` contains valid payment proof (signature, authorization, etc.)
- Use the X402 facilitator to verify payment settlement according to the specific scheme
- Confirm payment amount and recipient match the original payment requirements

#### Other Protocol Payment Proof Processing

Future payment protocols will define their own proof structures and processing requirements.

## Error Handling

### Payment Error Classification

MCP payment implementations **MUST** handle various error scenarios with appropriate JSON-RPC error responses:

| Scenario                  | JSON-RPC Code | Description                          | Example                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Payment Required          | -32803        | Tool requires payment                | Initial payment challenge                 |
| Payment Settlement Failed | -32803        | Payment processing failed            | Insufficient funds, network error         |
| Invalid Payment Proof     | -32602        | Malformed payment data               | Invalid signature, missing fields         |
| Payment Timeout           | -32603        | Payment verification timeout         | Facilitator unavailable                   |
| Unsupported Protocol      | -32601        | Payment protocol not supported       | Server doesn't support specified protocol |
| Internal Payment Error    | -32603        | Server-side payment processing error | Database error, facilitator API error     |

### Payment-Required Errors (-32803)

Payment-required scenarios use error code -32803 with structured payment information:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32803,
    "message": "Payment required",
    "data": {
      "protocol": "x402",
      "resource": {
        "url": "mcp://tool/premium_weather",
        "description": "Premium weather analysis tool",
        "mimeType": "application/json"
      },
      "paymentInfo": {
        // Protocol-specific payment requirements
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Technical Payment Errors

Technical errors use standard JSON-RPC error codes:

**Invalid Payment Proof (-32602):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Invalid payment proof: missing signature field"
  }
}
```

**Internal Payment Error (-32603):**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "Payment facilitator unavailable"
  }
}
```

### Resource Identification

Payment-related resources **SHOULD** use MCP-specific URI schemes for clear identification:

- **Tools**: `mcp://tool/{tool_name}`
- **Resources**: `mcp://resource/{resource_name}`
- **Prompts**: `mcp://prompt/{prompt_name}`

This provides consistent resource identification across payment contexts and enables clear audit trails.

## Security Considerations

### Payment Security

MCP implementations **MUST** follow protocol-specific security best practices:

1. **Secure Communication**: All payment communications **MUST** use HTTPS
2. **Facilitator Trust**: Only integrate with trusted, protocol-compliant facilitators
3. **Payment Validation**: Verify all payment proofs through the designated facilitator
4. **Audit Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all payment activities

### Protocol-Specific Security Models

#### X402 Security Model

The X402 protocol provides security through:

1. **Cryptographic Proofs**: Payment schemes use cryptographic verification
2. **Facilitator Mediation**: Trusted facilitators handle settlement verification
3. **Time-Limited Challenges**: Payment challenges include expiration times
4. **Scheme-Specific Security**: Each X402 scheme implements appropriate security measures

#### Other Protocol Security

Future payment protocols will define their own security models and requirements.

### Privacy Protection

Implementations **MUST** protect user privacy:

1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary payment information as defined by the protocol
2. **Facilitator Privacy**: Rely on facilitator privacy policies for payment data
3. **Local Data Handling**: Minimize local storage of payment-related information
4. **Compliance**: Follow applicable privacy regulations

## Integration with Authorization

### Combined Authorization and Payment

MCP servers **MAY** combine authorization and payment requirements. In such cases:

1. **Authentication First**: Verify user identity before requesting payment
2. **Tool-Based Pricing**: Different tools may have different payment requirements
3. **Payment Per Invocation**: Each tool call may require separate payment verification
4. **Unified Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages for both auth and payment failures

### Authorization with Payment Proof

When combining OAuth with payments, clients **MUST** include both authorization headers and the `paymentProof` field in the tool call:

**Request with Authorization and Payment:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "New York"
    },
    "paymentProof": {
      "protocol": "x402",
      "proof": {
        "x402Version": 2,
        "scheme": "exact",
        "network": "base-sepolia",
        "payload": {
          "signature": "0x21a17fba349406ccfab200d45d0bf0861d380b5d56d17ac2df78b56367669018792dc8c56bb68da876158600e787f36561db543b9113105724ea28610d66b8c31b",
          "authorization": {
            "from": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b",
            "to": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b",
            "value": "1000",
            "validAfter": "1766095470",
            "validBefore": "1766096130",
            "nonce": "0xeba19931184d6455732604dedbeb52e0c43dcc655e4e55e550543ecb0d050557"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTP transport, the Authorization header would be included alongside the JSON-RPC request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

This approach ensures payment proof works across all transport mechanisms while maintaining compatibility with existing authorization patterns.

## Settlement Response

### Payment Settlement Communication

After processing a payment and executing the requested tool, servers **SHOULD** include settlement information in the response to provide confirmation and audit trail details.

### Settlement Response Format

For successful tool executions with payment, servers **MAY** include a `paymentResponse` field in the result with protocol-specific settlement data:

#### X402 Settlement Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Tool execution result..."
      }
    ],
    "paymentResponse": {
      "protocol": "x402",
      "settlement": {
        "success": true,
        "transactionId": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
        "network": "eip155:84532",
        "payer": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b",
        "amount": "10000",
        "asset": "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Future Protocol Settlement Responses

Other payment protocols will define their own settlement response structures within the `paymentResponse.settlement` field.

### Settlement Failure Response

If payment settlement fails during tool execution, servers **MUST** return an error response with protocol-specific settlement details:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32803,
    "message": "Payment settlement failed",
    "data": {
      "protocol": "x402",
      "resource": {
        "url": "mcp://tool/get_weather",
        "description": "Premium weather data tool",
        "mimeType": "application/json"
      },
      "paymentInfo": {
        // Original payment requirements
      },
      "paymentResponse": {
        "protocol": "x402",
        "settlement": {
          "success": false,
          "errorReason": "insufficient_funds",
          "transactionId": "",
          "network": "eip155:84532",
          "payer": "0x14cE5605DD37502755D6308Bfef5B99363327D4b"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Settlement Response Structure

The `paymentResponse` field **MUST** include:

- **protocol**: Payment protocol identifier (e.g., "x402", "future_protocol")
- **settlement**: Protocol-specific settlement data

#### X402 Settlement Fields

For X402 protocol, the `settlement` object includes:

- **success**: Boolean indicating payment settlement success
- **transactionId**: Blockchain transaction hash
- **network**: Network identifier where payment was processed
- **payer**: Address of the payment sender
- **amount**: Amount that was paid (optional)
- **asset**: Asset contract address that was used for payment (optional)
- **errorReason**: Reason for settlement failure (required when success is false)

#### Future Protocol Settlement Fields

Future payment protocols will define their own settlement field requirements within the `settlement` object.

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

### Protocol Compliance

MCP implementations **MUST** comply with the requirements of their chosen payment protocols:

#### X402 Protocol Compliance

For X402 implementations:

1. **Scheme Compliance**: Follow X402 specifications for supported payment schemes
2. **Facilitator Integration**: Use only X402-compliant facilitators
3. **Protocol Versioning**: Clearly specify supported X402 protocol versions
4. **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility with other X402 implementations

#### Other Protocol Compliance

Future payment protocols will define their own compliance requirements.

### Terms of Service

Servers offering paid tools **SHOULD** provide clear terms of service including:

1. **Pricing Information**: Clear, upfront pricing for tool access
2. **Payment Terms**: Conditions for tool access and payment requirements
3. **Service Availability**: Uptime guarantees for paid tools
4. **Protocol Compliance**: Reference to supported payment protocol compliance
